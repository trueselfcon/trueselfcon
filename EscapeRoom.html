		<p>Margaret suggested I do something fun that could also count as a "team building" and "get to know you" event. Since I don't know what people do for fun, she suggested an Escape Room and, after getting some details, I've gone again with it. So here is your invitation to come to my room... AndImeanmyescaperoomnotmybedroomyoupervert! ...On April 5th, 2025 from 1PM-5PM. I expect you to be there.</p>
		
        <p>Welcome everyone!  As the above suggests, you are being invited to a custom-made escape room based around the Persona 4 Golden game, where you will find your memory and patience tested.  This event is being set up not only so everyone can get together outside of the convention scene for some fun but also as a way to continue raising funds for an eventual Fan-based Persona convention.  Below I have tried to answer all the questions I can think might be asked, but you are welcome to mail me at ryoma_meeiz@yahoo.com or contact me on Discord under ryokurama if you don't see things answered here. </p> 
		<p>Please be aware that the escape room portion itself will be approximately 90 minutes, the rest will be games and mingling.</p>
